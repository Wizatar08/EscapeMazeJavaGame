# StealAndEscapeJavaGame
Name likely to change in the future.

Only src and lib files added (out files excluded).

This game is in early development, the game structure's code is still being developed.

[UPDATE as of June 17]

Bugs to fix later:
- [PRIORITY] Enemy's glitch when trying to change direction.
- In the editor, items render above the UI

Additions to add later:
- More tile textures should be added
- Button hover and click should be added
- Buttons should only activate when mouse is released rather than pressed
